JAVA BACKEND INTRODUCTION

Backend is the part logic of an application, and is hide for the user.
The frontend is the communication with the user, with windows and layers.

The user uses the frontend, but the real function is in the backend. It include the database connection, business logic, dependecies, libraries, and the information management.

Spring is a framework for generate projects. 
Spring boot is the technology to create a spring base of applicaction, with dependencies for make too easy the developement.

A spring application is organized by packages -> main/java/como/example/demo/Application
The main is the method for runnning a spring application

The dependencies are the part where is included the spring logic
The pom.xml has the principal configuration.

Spring-boot-starter -> Configuration application
Spring-boot-starter-test -> Configuration test

The configuration build is the configurtion about maven and the way is compiled.

The repositories are the source where are the libraries to use. For each actualization, there a repository.

When you inicitailize an spring application, spring boot is inicializated.

Packaging is the way that a project is compiled or compressed.

When a spring application is with Maven or Gradle, the application contains the same inforation, but the way is implemented and organized is different.

When you change the configuration in the gradle or pom, is necessary syncronize the project
Syncronize - > Downlonging the actualizations and dependecies of spring boot

Settings gradle never can change for us.
